My heart aches for you that must use this script.

So heres the scenario, you got a printer that you need to connect to wifi via WPA2 Personal via a shared key.
Pretty standard stuff, you just enter a password and bada-bing, bada-boom. 
Only problem is that entering in a character via the printers buttons requires scrolling up and down before selecting a character.
Not only that, but the display cuts off after 13 characters or so. And you have no clue what you are typing next.
This script calculates the amount of up and down presses needed to enter in a given character, assuming your printer uses the same rotation of characters as mine.

Anyways, goodbye to this godforsaken solution
